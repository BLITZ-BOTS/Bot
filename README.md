This bot is designed to load and manage plugins dynamically, handling their respective events and commands.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a clear directory structure that separates the core bot code, configuration, and plugin functionality. Each plugin can define its own commands and events, making it easy to add or remove functionality as needed.

```
.
├── bot.ts                  
└── plugins                
    └── plugin_1
        ├── blitz.config.yaml           
        ├── events          
        │   └── ready.ts    
        └── commands        
            └── ping.ts     
```

### Explanation of Key Files and Directories

- **`bot.ts`**: The main entry point for the bot. This file is responsible for initializing the bot, loading configuration settings, and dynamically importing plugins along with their events and commands.
- **`plugins/`**: Contains all plugins. Each plugin is organized into subdirectories for `events` and `commands`, which helps in managing individual plugin functionality independently. Each plugin contains a `blitz.config.yaml` file which contains all metadata and config for a plugin.

### Example Plugin Structure

Each plugin follows a standardized structure within the `plugins/` folder. For example:

```
plugin_1
├── blitz.config.yaml
├── events
│   └── ready.ts            
└── commands
    └── ping.ts       
```

This structure helps keep the bot modular and scalable. Adding a new plugin is as simple as creating a new folder under `plugins` and adding corresponding event or command files.
